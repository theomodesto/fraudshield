## 13. Open Questions

1. **Risk Score Calculation**: What specific signals and weights should be used to calculate the risk score? Should machine learning be incorporated in the first version?

2. **Fraud Response Customization**: To what extent should merchants be able to customize the system's response to different risk score levels?

3. **Historical Data**: How will the system bootstrap fraud detection without historical transaction data for new merchants?

4. **Multi-tenancy Isolation**: How strictly should merchant data be isolated for multi-tenant scenarios?

5. **Privacy Compliance Regions**: Are there specific regional privacy regulations beyond GDPR and CCPA that need to be addressed?
